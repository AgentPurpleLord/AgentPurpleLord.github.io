## Introduction

I am not a particularly skilled programmer, but I thought it would be a fun project to work on my girlfriends website for her cosplay and sewing ambitions. And thus far it has been a REALLY fun adventure into the world of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and now Ruby with Jekyll. My goal is to create a functional, easy to access and interesting website by combining my prior knowledge as a deisnger on my journey through web development.

## Goals

A few of the goals with the website:

* A quick-to-load landing page that conveys a clear message.
* A gallery system with a CMS that allows a non-code experience person to add content.
* A commissions page that outlines a commission process for costumes.
* Something that is both functional and beautiful.
