hero_subheader: Adventures in Costume. Melbourne.
about_header: Who Am I?
about_body: Hi! I’m Lara. I’m a science student who by night and weekends loves to make costumes and dress up as my favourite characters. I learned to sew my own clothes in primary school and never lost my love of halloween and dress up days, so discovering cosplay was an epiphany for me. At first I was very shy and self conscious, but I persevered and am proud to have learned many new skills, made heaps of awesome friends and had amazing opportunities. I can’t wait to see where cosplay takes me next!
services:
  - name: Commissions
    icon: fas fa-magic
    body: Many costumes require extra special details to bring them to life. I've worked with leather, resin, lights and silicone - whatever it takes to make something that's out of this world!
  - name: Cosplay
    icon: fas fa-hat-wizard
    body: I frequent pop-culture and comic conventions in Melbourne and I hope to see you at one soon! These are a great opportunity to bring out an A-game costume or remake the entire cast of a series with friends.
  - name: Photoshoots
    icon: fas fa-camera-retro
    body: There are many friendly and talented photographers in Melbourne who are prepared to scale cliffs, descend waterfalls and get utterly lost in the mountains to capture the perfect photo. I am always ready to plan the next adventure with anyone who’d like to join me.
  - name: Events
    icon: fas fa-calendar-check
    body: One of the best parts of cosplay is seeing the reaction people coming face to face with their favourite character, especially kids! I have attended close to 50 charity events already, please get in touch if you think your next event could use more superheroes!
