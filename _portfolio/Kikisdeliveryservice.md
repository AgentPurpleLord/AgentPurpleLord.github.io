description: This was my first ever pro photoshoot back in May 2018! This location
  was chosen by Ian and was absolutely perfect - the autumn leaves were so beautiful.
  It took a lot of jumping around to get the flying shots perfect ad I couldn't love
  the results more; I have been hooked on shoots ever since!
